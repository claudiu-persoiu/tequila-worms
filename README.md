# Tequila-Worms

This is a revamped version of the [tequila-worms-old](https://github.com/claudiu-persoiu/tequila-worms-old) project.

It needs [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) to run.

```
npm install
  
bower install
  
npm start
```

The project is just a PoC of using Angular, Node.js, Socket.io, Coffee-script and Bootstrap as well as other dependecies to make everything work together.
